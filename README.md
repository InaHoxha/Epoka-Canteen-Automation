# Epoka-Canteen-Automation
Technology nowadays is involved in every field of our life making our everyday life and its activities easier and time-saving. Having the same purpose this software aims to facilitate the ordering process in the canteen which is an activity that takes most of the break time the students and staff of the university have. One solution to this problem might be the automation of the canteen. 

The automation of the canteen will be in the form of a Web Application which will be adopted to the needs that Epoka Canteen has and in the same time the management of the canteen company will become simpler to handle during peek hours.

This system will give the client side users (students and staff) the flexibility of ordering online in real time reducing the time-consuming queues. Due to real time communication between the cashier and the client the transaction will be faster and more optimized at the same time. On the other side the canteen staff will have more organized work-flow and better management in taking, delivering  orders and also managing their inner organization. 

This application will be an extension of the existing Epoka University Web Application in order for accounts of the students to be safer and also easier for them to adopt with.
